		<p style="background-color: #e5e4e2">The picture above is my pet dog, Luna. My family and I got her from Mexico about seven years ago and she is a mutt. There is a lot of speculation with regards to which breed she might be mixed with but I suspect she definitely has some poodle in her. She is one of the smartest dogs I have come across in my life. Luna does not know a lot of tricks because we never really bothered to teach her much, but she can sit, follow, lay down, jump, stand up, bark, handshake, and not move on command. She is also great at alerting us when something weird happens or someone unrecognized is near our house. On a final note, a weird thing about Luna is that her nose was pitch black when she was a puppy and now it is red!</p>

		<p style="background-color: #e5e4e2">The picture above is my of my other dog, Teddy. He is a Chinese Pug that we got from a breeder about three years ago. He is so funny and cuddly but not exactly the most intelligent dog. You can trick him easily, as one time I had a treat in my hand and then pretended to throw it and Teddy spent about 10 solid minutes trying to find the treat. And that's another thing, Teddy will eat just about anything, he has eaten things like plastic, foam, toys, toilet paper, etc., and of course we do our best to stop him from doing so, but it was just unexpected when he first started doing it. Teddy unlike Luna, barely reacts to strangers or other dogs, so he is much easier to walk and although he rarely listens to commands, but he at least follows you if you are walking out in the open.
