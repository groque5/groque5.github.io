		<p style="background-color: #e5e4e2">Hello my name is Gil, I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I initially spent my first two years of university at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, where I majored in finance and accounting. I found myself longing for a big city experience, so I decided to transfer to Madison, in an effort to satiate that desire. I was wishy washy with my major at first but eventually after many changes, settled on economics, which I will be finishing in spring 2022.</p>
