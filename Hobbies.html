			  <dt>Hiking</dt>
			  <dd style="background-color: #e5e4e2">I enjoy hiking, especially when it is cool outside. Unfortunately, I have not been able to hike much due to the whole covid situation and I have gained a lot of weight, making it harder to walk for long periods of time.</dd>
			  <dt>Gaming</dt>
			  <dd style="background-color: #e5e4e2">I have been a gamer for as long as I can remember. Nowadays I do not play console games that much, in large part because I have not upgraded past the ps3, but I do play computer games, namely, League of Legends. I am basically addicted to that game. It is a multiplayer online battle arena game and the objective of the game is to destroy the enemies nexus, which is this large crystal like structure that sits in the enemy's base. Many hours were spent on this game since I started when I was 16.</dd>
			  <dt>Watching Movies</dt>
			  <dd style="background-color: #e5e4e2">I love watching movies. In particular, I really appreciate comedic movies. My favorite comedic movie is Scary Movie 1. The humor is a bit crude and there are a lot of stereotypes but I feel like that is what makes it so funny, because you would not be able to get away with that nowadays. The movie is basically a parody of the popular scary movies, like Scream.</dd>
			  <dt>Playing With My Dogs</dt>
			  <dd style="background-color: #e5e4e2">I enjoy playing with my dogs and taking them on walks, as they seem super excited to explore the area around them. Both my dogs, Luna and Teddy, have an abundant amount of energy, although Luna gets annoyed by Teddy pretty easily, so she stops playing sometimes. They both latch onto rope like pitbulls and are surprisingly strong for their small size. Tug of war is their favorite game with fetching items in second place. Seeing them happy brings me peace.</dd>
